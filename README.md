# My Reversi Project

This is an online Reversi/Othello game, complete with an AI opponent. It's not the most beautiful, and it doesn't actually play Reversi yet, only Othello, but the Reversi rules will soon be implemented. And some more beauty and accessibility should follow.

## Origin

The Bothello AI comes from an old university project, initially implemented in C. It has been ported to Rust to make the compilation to WebAssembly easier, and the interface has been adapted to work better in this application, but the original algorithm and heuristics are preserved.

This project was created, a few years later, to finally let me (and you!) play against my AI.
